# Fly
Fly is a HTML/PHP/JavaScript/whatever else -based "operating system" that I started working on when I was 14 years old.

(For the full history, see my [A Brief History of Fly Tumblr post](//myboringcoding.tumblr.com/post/167342691393/a-brief-history-of-fly))

I am (almost) entirely self-taught in every language used in this project, so there is a ton of code (old and new) that is horrible, but I'm slowly making it better (I hope).

Running Fly

If for some reason you want to try to run this thing, see the [Running Fly](//github.com/kitkatzecat/fly/wiki/Running-Fly) wiki page.
