# Fly
Fly is a HTML/PHP/JavaScript/whatever else -based "operating system" that I started working on when I was 14 years old.

(For the full histroy, see my [A Brief History of Fly Tumblr post](https://myboringcoding.tumblr.com/post/167342691393/a-brief-history-of-fly))

I am entirely self-taught in every language used in this project, so there is a ton of code (old and new) that is horrible, but I'm slowly making it better (I hope).

Running Fly
-----------
If for some reason you want to try to run this thing, you'll need a Linux (I use Ubuntu, but I have tested it to work on Debian and Raspbian) or Windows (though some stuff may not work as well, I haven't run it natively on Windows in a while) installation of Apache and PHP.

The only weird thing to make sure is set up in config is that the "system/include" directory is included in PHP's list of areas to check for include files.
Personally, I run it in a Ubuntu installation running on Windows Subsystem for Linux.

Once it's running on the server side, use your favorite web browser (my browser of choice is MS Edge, thus the one it's most tested on, though I know it works in Chromium and maybe Firefox) and just navigate to the IP of the server.
